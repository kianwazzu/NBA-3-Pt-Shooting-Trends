# Personal-Dataset NBA 3 Point Shooting Over the Last 5 Seasons

# Motivation
I have always been a big fan of basketball at all levels, especially in the NBA. One thing I have noticed from watching games and using social media is that many say that the game of basketball has changed or "in today's game," directly referring to the amount of three point shooting. Numerous NBA Game announcers I watched might comment something along the lines of how the game they are watching includes more shooting than back when they played. On social media, I will often see various users comparing past and present players claiming that a player from an older generation would not be good at all in today's game. After seeing both highly accredited NBA Announcers, and the average NBA fan, comment on the changes in how the game is played I wondered just how much the game has changed over time. What I originally aimed to figure out was if there was a direct correlation between the amount of 3 point shooting a team does, and the amount of games they win in a season.
